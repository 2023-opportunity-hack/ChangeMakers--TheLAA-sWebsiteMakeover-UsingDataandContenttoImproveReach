# ChangeMakers for The LAA
## About the LAA 
This nonprofit organization aims to support new and current Latin American families in Georgia through various services like:

- Job searches
- Immigration security
- Adult education
- Translation
- Facility rentals

## Problem Statement
Many features on the LAA's website were largely outdated, making it difficult for its users to navigate and thus inhibiting the organization's ability to help those in need. The NPO was in need of a more efficient layout for their website that could be conveniently used with mobile devices. They also lacked a method for an efficient transition from English to Spanish on their website, leading to two separate websites instead of one. Along with this, the NPO was unable to retarget their past contributors or understand what types of people were requiring which services. This problem made it difficult for the organization to maintain their necessary support.  

## What We Did
Our team created:

- A fresh and de-cluttered front-end layout for their new website using Canva by condensing their information on single pages, rather than maintianing their previously distanced and repetative form. This allows the NPO to present their services and information on mobile devices with clarity.
- An option for a single website that can convert from English to Spanish, rather than two separate websites. This allows for simpler maitinance for both the user and NPO.
- A Google Analytics 4 account that could be translated onto their new website. This would make understanding the website's use and retargeting their past donors much easier.  

## Challenges We Faced
The NPO was unable to provide us with useable or organized files, may of which being empty or erroneous. Along with this, the drive given containing their back-end information and plug-ins could not be completely downloaded and the PHP and WordPress used were outdated. This in turn led to major compatibility issues and made it incredibly difficult to edit and remaster their back-end.

## What We Learned
Google Analytics 4 is a robust platform that can provide a one-glance view of how one's website is being used. With its customizability, the user is able to tailor its specific data collection for their needs. We also learned that with a compatible platform and plugins, this service can be integrated into any type of website. 

## Continuing The LAA Website Makeover 
In the future, the LAA's website would need to be hosted on a modern WordPress platform with an integrated, costomized Google Analytics 4 account. This would require the implementation of modern plugins that would support this service. The Google Analytics 4 account could be costomized by the administrator to track whichever services or pages they would like data on. Similarly, based on this data, the NPO would be able to target certain users to recieve advertisements that encourage more interaction with their site and organization.
